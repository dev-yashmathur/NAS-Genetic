-> Neural Architecture Search is basically training multiple child networks with different hyperparameters to then find the best one, to do complete extensive training on
-> The goal of NAS is to be able to get
    a) A better or at par accuracy
    b) The best possible efficiency to achieve this accuracy

-> Parameters for evaluation to be considered:
    a) accuracy
    b) num of weights
    c) num of calculations

-> The main steps for NAS are:
    a) Defining the search space
        i. Number of hidden layers
        ii. Number of Nodes per hidden layers
        iii. Activation function
    b) Model generation
    c) evaluation
    d) Choosing next model (Search algorithm)
